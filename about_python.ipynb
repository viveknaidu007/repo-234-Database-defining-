    "If the tables are already created in SQL, why do we need to define them in SQLAlchemy models? The short answer is: **to allow your Flask app to interact with the database using Python code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a detailed explanation of why we define models:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Bridge Between Your Code and the Database**\n",
    "SQLAlchemy models serve as an interface between your Python application and the database. Even though the tables already exist in SQL, defining models allows you to interact with the database programmatically using Python instead of writing raw SQL queries every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Without SQLAlchemy (raw SQL)\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM Group_details WHERE group_id = 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# With SQLAlchemy\n",
    "group = GroupDetails.query.get(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Object Relational Mapping (ORM)**\n",
    "SQLAlchemy is an **ORM (Object Relational Mapper)**. This means it maps your database tables (like `Group_details` and `Group_devices`) to Python classes, so you can work with rows of data as Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Instead of raw SQL\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO Group_details (group_id, group_name, comp_id) VALUES (1, 101, 5001)\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use SQLAlchemy ORM\n",
    "group = GroupDetails(group_id=1, group_name=101, comp_id=5001)\n",
    "db.session.add(group)\n",
    "db.session.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Maintainability and Scalability**\n",
    "When you define models, your code becomes more maintainable:\n",
    "- Models serve as a single source of truth about the database schema in your Python app.\n",
    "- If the database schema changes, you only need to update the model definition instead of finding and fixing every raw SQL query in your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Relationships and Query Optimization**\n",
    "SQLAlchemy makes it easy to define relationships between tables and handle them efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `GroupDevices` table has a foreign key reference to the `GroupDetails` table. With SQLAlchemy:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Fetch all devices for a group\n",
    "group = GroupDetails.query.get(1)\n",
    "devices = group.devices  # Automatically fetches related devices\n",
    "```\n",
    "This avoids manual joins and simplifies queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Database Independence**\n",
    "If you decide to switch databases (e.g., from SQLite to PostgreSQL), your raw SQL queries might require significant changes. However, if you're using SQLAlchemy, most of the code will remain unchanged because SQLAlchemy handles database dialects internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Leverage SQLAlchemy Features**\n",
    "Defining models gives you access to powerful SQLAlchemy features, such as:\n",
    "- Validation of data types.\n",
    "- Eager loading (e.g., fetching related data efficiently).\n",
    "- Automatic migrations (with tools like Alembic).\n",
    "- Declarative syntax for more readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When You Don’t Need Models\n",
    "If your Flask app only needs to run a few raw SQL queries and doesn’t require complex interactions, you **could skip defining models**. You can directly use raw SQL like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "db = SQLAlchemy()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example raw SQL query\n",
    "result = db.session.execute(\"SELECT * FROM Group_details WHERE group_id = 1\").fetchall()\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, this approach becomes harder to maintain and scale as your app grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Defining models in SQLAlchemy is **not mandatory** if your tables already exist, but it significantly improves:\n",
    "- Developer productivity.\n",
    "- Code readability.\n",
    "- Scalability of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only need minimal database access, raw SQL queries might suffice. But for more complex apps, **models are highly recommended.**\n"
